Fish Image Recognition in Android App 

In this project, we are going to develop an android app that uses mobile phone camera to classify 15 different types of fishes realtime.

## Data Collection and Machine Learning Pipeline

There isn’t a comprehensive labeled dataset available for fish species so I built my own dataset of 120+ images from scratch. 
I collected images using a few different methods outlined below.

### Data Sources:

1) Bing image search
2) instagram by hashtag (i.e. #browntrout)

After collecting the images, I manually reviewed all of the photos to ensure that the images matched their respective trout species label and removed any miscellaneous images that didn’t belong (fishing equipment, a river, tackle box, incorrectly labeled fish species, etc).
The data collection and cleaning phase took about one weeks. Now equipped with 120+ images across 15 fish species, I had an initial image dataset to start building a deep learning fish identification model. 
Although there were so many images that I ignore them because data collection is a time-consuming process.
